		/* Go about in a systematic way! Perhaps first, you'll want to

		1. Draw it out, think about what shapes/colors/sizes you'd want to use
		2. Define your scales, could be Quantized ones or linear ones, upto you.
		3. Map your data to your scales, use d3.extent or d3.map (Perhaps refer to the API).
		   Or perhaps you could look  at the data and think about it.
		4. Start writing code for each dimension visualization, the position has already been taken care of.
		   So, just worry about size, color and such.
		5. Append your labels, legends etc. Basically, make your visualization understandable.
